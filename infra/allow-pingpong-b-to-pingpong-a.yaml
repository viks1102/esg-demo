# The allow-pingpong-a-to-pingpong-b policy allows pingpong-a pods to send traffic to pingpong-b pods on port 8080 (or any port you specify).
# The deny-all policies block all ingress and egress traffic within the pingpong-a and pingpong-b namespaces, except for the traffic allowed by the allow-pingpong-a-to-pingpong-b policy.
# The pod selectors are based on labels (app.kubernetes.io/name in this case). Ensure that the labels in your pod definitions match these selectors.
